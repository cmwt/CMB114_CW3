# Introduction

Within this repository is the paired coursework content for Felix Plasser's CMB114 CW3 project.
The students working in this repository are William Thomas (F223975) and Oliver Rhodes (F228544). 

Our programme is a simple graphical user-interface (GUI) application, with a command line interface (CLI) counterpart, that has the 
ability to convert between a selection of SI and non-SI units that relate to the field of Chemistry and Physics.

# Running Unit Converter

The user will need to install the latest version of Python on their computer and tick the 
'Add Python 3.xx to PATH' option so that any packages required to run the GUI can be
installed to your system. The python download links can be found at:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

In order to run the Unit Converter, the user should clone this repository to their local machine using Git CMD,
download available from the following link:

https://git-scm.com/downloads

Once this has downloaded, open Git CMD, navigate to the directory within which the user would like to clone 
the repository then run 'git clone https://github.com/cmwt/CMB114_CW3' and hit enter. 

To run the GUI, navigate to the CMB114_CW3 directory that has just been cloned in and type 'python main.py'.
If the user would like to run the CLI version, type 'python main_cli.py'. 

# Guide to Unit Converter

Set up in the top frame of the GUI is the settings of the unit converter in which the unit type can 
be altered along with the unit of measure. When the calculate button is clicked, the conversion is displayed 
in the output entry on the right-hand frame of the GUI, underneath some general reference information 
regarding that unit type. 

The CLI is slightly different. When the user runs the CLI, there will be a main menu with a numbered list of 
options from which the user can select and follow the on-screen instructions to use the unit converter.
