# Introduction

Within this repository is the paired coursework content for Felix Plasser's CMB114 CW3 project.
The students working in this repository are William Thomas (F223975) and Oliver Rhodes (F228544). 

Our programme is a simple GUI application that has the ability to convert between a selection of 
SI and non-SI units that relate to the field of Chemistry and Physics.

# Running Unit Converter

In order to run the programme, you will need to install the latest version of Python to your computer and 
tick the 'Add Python 3.xx to PATH' option so that any packages required to run the GUI are able to be
installed to your system. 

# Guide to Unit Converter

Set up in the left-hand frame of the GUI is the settings of the unit converter in which the unit type can 
be altered along with the unit of measure. When the calculate button is clicked, the conversion is displayed 
in the output entry on the right-hand frame of the GUI, underneath some general reference information 
regarding that unit type.
